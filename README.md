# ðŸŽ° Slot Machine AI - ML, DevOps & Docker Integrated Project

This project is an AI-powered **Slot Machine Simulation**, integrating **Machine Learning (ML), DevOps, CI/CD (Jenkins), Docker, and automated testing**. 

The goal is to **simulate a slot machine**, track game results in an SQLite database, and **predict future winnings using Machine Learning (ML)**. 

## ðŸš€ Features
âœ… **Slot Machine Simulation** â€“ Play a simple slot machine game.  
âœ… **Machine Learning (ML) Predictions** â€“ Predicts possible winnings based on past game data using `RandomForestRegressor`.  
âœ… **Database Integration (SQLite)** â€“ Saves all game results for ML training.  
âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)** â€“ Automates testing, builds, and deployment.  
âœ… **Docker Containerization** â€“ Run the project in any environment with Docker.  
âœ… **Automated Testing (pytest)** â€“ Ensures reliability and correctness.
